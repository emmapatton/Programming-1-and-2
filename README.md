# Programming and Scripting Module
## Problem Sets 

### Weeks 1 & 2 - Problem Set 1 and 2: 
- **Problem 1 Description:** This program, written by Ian McLoughlin, calculates the *nth* Fibonacci number where *n* is the sum of the first and last letters of my first name, as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on.

- **Problem 2 Description:** This program, written by Ian McLoughlin, displays fibonacci numbers using peoples names. In this example, my surname *Patton* is used.

- **File Name:** fibname.py

### Week 3 - Problem Set 3: 
- **Description:** This program is based on the **Collatz Conjecture.** It is a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. First the user must enter an input. At each iteration, the current value of the integer  is printed to the screes, along with the number of iterations needed to reach 1.  

- **File Name:** collatz.py

### Week 5 - Problem Set 4:
- euler5.py 
- Project Euler - Problem 5

### Week 6 - Problem Set 5:
- irisdata.py
- Formatting Iris Data Set

### Week 7 - Problem Set 6:
- factorial.py
- Using a function to find the factorial of a number
