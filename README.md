# Programming and Scripting Module
## Problem Sets 

### Weeks 1 & 2 - Problem Set 1 and 2: 
- **File Name:** fibname.py
- **Problem 1 Description:** This program, written by Ian McLoughlin, calculates the * *nth* * Fibonacci number where * *n* * is the sum of the first and last letters of my first name, as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on.
   
- **Problem 2 Description:** This program, written by Ian McLoughlin, displays fibonacci numbers using peoples names. In this example, my surname * *Patton* * is used.

### Week 3 - Problem Set 3: 
- **File Name:** collatz.py
- **Description:** This program is based on the **Collatz Conjecture.** It is a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer has been printed to the screen. The starting value is 17. If you wish to enhance your program, have the program ask the user for the integer instead of specifying a value at the start of your code.
