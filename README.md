# Programming and Scripting Module
Programming and Scripting Module Problem Sets for the online Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT). 
Python is the programming language covered in this module. Visual Studio Code was the editor used to write the following problem sets. 

## Problem Sets 

### Weeks 1 & 2 - Problem Set 1 and 2: 
- **Problem 1 Description:** This program, written by Ian McLoughlin, calculates the *nth* **fibonacci** [1] number where *n* is the sum of the first and last letters of my first name *(Emma)*, as numbers. It specifies that A is 1, B is 2, C is 3 etc. Please refer to the file fibname.py for the result in comments. 

- **Problem 2 Description:** This program, written by Ian McLoughlin, displays **fibonacci** numbers using peoples names. In this example, my surname *Patton* is used. Please refer to the file fibname.py for the result in comments. 

- **File Name:** fibname.py

### Week 3 - Problem Set 3: 
- **Description:** This program is based on the **Collatz Conjecture** [2]. It is a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. First the user must enter an input. At each iteration, the current value of the integer  is printed to the screen, along with the number of iterations needed to reach 1.  

- **File Name:** collatz.py

### Week 5 - Problem Set 4:
- **Description:** This problem set provides a solution to **Project Euler Problem 5**. Project Euler [3] which is named after Leonhard Euler is a website containing a series of challenging computer programming problems. 
  - Problem 5 [4] states: *2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?*
  
- **File Name:** Euler5.py

### Week 6 - Problem Set 5:
- **Description:** This program is based on the Iris Data Set [5]. The Python script reads the Iris data set and prints the four numerical values on each row in a clear and easily read format, with a header for each of the four columns; petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width.  

- **File Name:** irisdata.py

### Week 7 - Problem Set 6:
- **Description:** This problem set uses the function **factorial()** [6] It takes a single positive integer and returns its factorial.
  - The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it, for exmaple the factorial of 4 is 4x3x2x1 which is equal to 24. 
  - This python script calculates the factorial of 5, 7, and 10.
- **File Name:** factorial.py

### Practice and Revision Folder
- **Description** This folder contains a number of short python scripts which were completed to aid my learning throughout the programming and scripting module. 
- **File Names:** fib.py, fizzbuzz.py, format.py, functions.py, guessing.py, if.py, listloop.py, lists.py, loop.py, loopsum.py, openfile.py, range.py, smallmult.py, sum35.py, test.py, test2.py, tuesday.py and tutorial.py.
