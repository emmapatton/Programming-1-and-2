# Programming and Scripting Module
Programming and Scripting Module Problem Sets for the online Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with GMIT. 
Python is the programming language covered in this module therefore all problem sets have been written in Python.


## Problem Sets 

### Weeks 1 & 2 - Problem Set 1 and 2: 
- **Problem 1 Description:** This program, written by Ian McLoughlin, calculates the *nth* **fibonacci** [1] number where *n* is the sum of the first and last letters of my first name, as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on.

- **Problem 2 Description:** This program, written by Ian McLoughlin, displays **fibonacci** numbers using peoples names. In this example, my surname *Patton* is used.

- **File Name:** fibname.py

### Week 3 - Problem Set 3: 
- **Description:** This program is based on the **Collatz Conjecture** [2]. It is a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. First the user must enter an input. At each iteration, the current value of the integer  is printed to the screen, along with the number of iterations needed to reach 1.  

- **File Name:** collatz.py

### Week 5 - Problem Set 4:
- **Description:** This problem set provides a solution to **Project Euler Problem 5**. Project Euler [3] which is named after Leonhard Euler is a website containing a series of challenging computer programming problems. 
  - Problem 5 [4] states: *2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?*
  
- **File Name:** Euler5.py

### Week 6 - Problem Set 5:
- irisdata.py
- Formatting Iris Data Set

### Week 7 - Problem Set 6:
- factorial.py
- Using a function to find the factorial of a number 

### Practice and Revision Folder
- **Description** This folder contains a number of short python files which are related to learning and practice throughout the programming and scripting module. 
- **File Names:** fib.py, fizzbuzz.py, format.py, functions.py, guessing.py, if.py, listloop.py, lists.py, loop.py, loopsum.py, openfile.py, range.py, smallmult.py, sum35.py, test.py, test2.py, tuesday.py and tutorial.py.
